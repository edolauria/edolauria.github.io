Hello! I am a theoretical physicists currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at **Quantic** group, at ENS & Mines Paris & INRIA.

I am interested in **non-perturbative aspects** of **Quantum Field Theories** (QFTs) and **Conformal Field Theories** (CFTs), with or without **boundaries** or **defects**, with applications ranging from condensed matter to strings. I try to address these problems within the **bootstrap framework**, namely by exploiting theory's consistency conditions and without referring to any particular microscopic description.

My results include: 

  - A partial classification of **conformal boundary conditions** for the 4d Maxwell theory and for a free massless scalar in three and four dimensions;
  - A classification of unitary **conformal defects** in the theory of a free massless scalar in dimensions greater that two;
  - A bootstrap study of **long-range vector models**;
  - A study of **renormalization group flows** for **QFTs in AdS** background.
  
I have worked on similar classification problems for symetrimmetric theories: in the context of the superconformal bootstrap to study a family of 3d SCFTs connected by a conformal manifold, and in the context of N=2 supegravity theories in three, four and five dimensions.
