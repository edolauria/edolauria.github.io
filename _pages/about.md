My research is focused on understanding non-perturbative aspects of Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) and Conformal Field Theories (CFTs), with or without boundaries or defects, with applications ranging from condensed matter to strings. I try to address these problems within the bootstrap framework, namely by exploiting theory's consistency conditions and without referring to any particular microscopic description. My results include: a partial classification of conformal boundary conditions for the 4d Maxwell theory and for a free massless scalar in dimensions $d=3,4$; a classification of unitary conformal defects in the theory of a free massless scalar in d>2; a bootstrap study of conformal line defects with continuous global symmetry and of long-range vector models; a study of renormalization group flows for QFTs in AdS background. I have worked on similar classification problems for supersymmetric CFTs (SCFTs) without defects: in the context of the superconformal bootstrap to study a family of 3d SCFTs connected by a conformal manifold, and in the context of N=2 supegravity theories in d=4,5,6.
