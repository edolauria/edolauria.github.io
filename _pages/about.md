Theoretical physicist currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the **Quantic** group, at ENS & Mines Paris & INRIA.

I am interested in **non-perturbative aspects** of **Quantum Field Theories** (QFTs) and **Conformal Field Theories** (CFTs), with or without **boundaries** or **defects**, with applications ranging from condensed matter to string theory. I try to address these problems within the **bootstrap framework**, namely by exploiting the theoryâ€™s consistency conditions without referring to any particular microscopic description.

**Keywords** : CFTs and Bootstrap, Boundaries and defects, Strong Coupling, QFT in curved background, Gauge Theories, Renormalization Group, Supersymmetry, Long-Range models.
