Hello! I am a theoretical physicist currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the **Quantic** group, at ENS & Mines Paris & INRIA.

I am interested in **non-perturbative aspects** of **Quantum Field Theories** (QFTs) and **Conformal Field Theories** (CFTs), with or without **boundaries** or **defects**, with applications ranging from condensed matter to string theory. I try to address these problems within the **bootstrap framework**, namely by exploiting the theoryâ€™s consistency conditions without referring to any particular microscopic description.

My results include: 

  - A classification of **conformal boundary conditions** for the 4d Maxwell theory and for free massless scalars in d>2;
  - A classification of unitary **conformal defects** in the theory of free massless scalars in d>2;
  - A bootstrap study of **Ising and long-range vector models**;
  - A study of **renormalization group flows** for **QFTs in AdS** background.
  
I have worked on similar classification problems for supersymmetric theories: in the context of the superconformal bootstrap to study a family of 3d SCFTs connected by a conformal manifold, and in the context of N=2 supergravity theories in three, four and five dimensions.
