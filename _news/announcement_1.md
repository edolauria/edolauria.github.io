The seminar series is organized into thematic periods lasting three months each. Each thematic period includes a kick-oﬀ event at the [Institut Henri Poincaré](https://www.ihp.fr/fr) and several talks at the [Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHES)](https://www.ihes.fr/), which are streamed on Zoom (a list can be found [here](https://seedseminar.apps.math.cnrs.fr/talks/)).

We are currently supported by the Fondation mathématique Jacques Hadamard, the CNRS and the IHES;
