This seminar series is structured into three-month thematic periods. Each thematic period is composed by: a kick-off event at [Institut Henri Poincaré](https://www.ihp.fr/fr) and a number of talks at [Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHES)](https://www.ihes.fr/), streamed on Zoom (a list can be found [here](https://seedseminar.apps.math.cnrs.fr/talks/)).

We are currently supported by the Fondation mathématique Jacques Hadamard, the CNRS and the IHES;
