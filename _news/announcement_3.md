Looking forward to join the workshop <a href="https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/bidw02/"> Diving Deeper into Defects: On the Intersection of Field Theory, Quantum Matter, and Mathematics </a>, at the Newton Institute in Cambridge this October!

This is part of a bigger workshop on <a href="https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/bid/"> Quantum field theory with boundaries, impurities, and defects </a>.
