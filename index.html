<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hello! I am a theoretical physicists currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at <strong>Quantic</strong> group, at ENS &amp; Mines Paris &amp; INRIA.</p> <p>I am interested in <strong>non-perturbative aspects</strong> of <strong>Quantum Field Theories</strong> (QFTs) and <strong>Conformal Field Theories</strong> (CFTs), with or without <strong>boundaries</strong> or <strong>defects</strong>, with applications ranging from condensed matter to strings. I try to address these problems within the <strong>bootstrap framework</strong>, namely by exploiting theoryâ€™s consistency conditions and without referring to any particular microscopic description.</p> <p>My results include:</p> <ul> <li>A partial classification of <strong>conformal boundary conditions</strong> for the 4d Maxwell theory and for a free massless scalar in three and four dimensions;</li> <li>A classification of unitary <strong>conformal defects</strong> in the theory of a free massless scalar in dimensions greater that two;</li> <li>A bootstrap study of <strong>long-range vector models</strong>;</li> <li>A study of <strong>renormalization group flows</strong> for <strong>QFTs in AdS</strong> background.</li> </ul> <p>I have worked on similar classification problems for symetrimmetric theories: in the context of the superconformal bootstrap to study a family of 3d SCFTs connected by a conformal manifold, and in the context of N=2 supegravity theories in three, four and five dimensions.</p> </body></html>
